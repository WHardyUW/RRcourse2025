## Viewership Statistics

\`\`\`{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE} library(readr) library(ggplot2) library(knitr) library(here) library(dplyr)

### Read the data

viewership \<- read_csv(here::here("data", "suits_viewership.csv"))

### Display table

knitr::kable(viewership, caption = "Average Viewership per Season (Millions)")

ggplot(viewership, aes(x = Season, y = Viewers)) + geom_line(size = 1.2, color = "#2c3e50") + geom_point(size = 3, color = "#e74c3c") + labs( title = "Suits - Seasonal Viewership Over Time", x = "Season", y = "Viewership (Millions)" ) + scale_x_continuous(breaks = viewership\$Season)

### Calculate changes

viewership \<- viewership %\>% arrange(Season) %\>% mutate(Change = Viewers - lag(Viewers))

### Plot changes

ggplot(viewership, aes(x = Season, y = Change)) + geom_col(fill = "#3498db") + geom_hline(yintercept = 0, linetype = "dashed", color = "gray50") + labs( title = "Season-over-Season Change in Viewership", x = "Season", y = "Change in Viewership (Millions)" )

## Observations

Viewership peaked at Season 3, with an average of 4.45 million viewers. From that point forward, viewership steadily declined. For instance:

Between Seasons 3 and 5, viewership dropped by 1.56 million (from 4.45M to 2.89M).

By the final season (Season 9), the average dropped further to just 0.91 million viewers.

This declining trend may reflect increased competition from streaming services or audience fatigue.
