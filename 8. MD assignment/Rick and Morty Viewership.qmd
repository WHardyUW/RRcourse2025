## Viewership Trends

To better understand the trends in *Rick and Morty*'s viewership, we plot the data below.

```{python}
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

# Data
seasons = ['Season 1', 'Season 2', 'Season 3', 'Season 4', 'Season 5']
viewership = [1.1, 2.1, 2.6, 2.4, 1.8]

# Plotting
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 5))
plt.plot(seasons, viewership, marker='o', color='b', linestyle='-', linewidth=2)
plt.title('Viewership Over Time')
plt.xlabel('Season')
plt.ylabel('Average Viewership (Millions)')
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()
```

## Episode-to-Episode Changes

To analyze changes in viewership between seasons, we calculate the difference in average viewership.

```{python}
# Calculate changes
changes = np.diff(viewership)

# Plotting
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 5))
plt.bar(seasons[1:], changes, color=['green' if c > 0 else 'red' for c in changes])
plt.title('Episode-to-Episode Changes in Viewership')
plt.xlabel('Season')
plt.ylabel('Change in Viewership (Millions)')
plt.axhline(0, color='black', linewidth=0.8, linestyle='--')
plt.grid(axis='y')
plt.show()
```
