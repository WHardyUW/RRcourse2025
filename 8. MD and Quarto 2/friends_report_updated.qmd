# Average U.S. viewership per season (in millions)
viewership_data = {

plt.title('Friends Viewership by Season')
plt.xlabel('Season')
plt.ylabel('Average Viewers (Millions)')
plt.xticks(df['Season'])
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()

```

plt.bar(df['Season'][1:], df['Pct_Change'][1:], color='green')
plt.title('Season-to-Season Change in Viewership (%)')
plt.xlabel('Season')
