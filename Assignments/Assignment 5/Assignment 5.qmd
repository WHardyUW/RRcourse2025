## Viewership Over Time

```{r}
ggplot(viewership_data, aes(x = EpisodeNumber, y = Viewers)) +
  geom_line(color = "steelblue", size = 1.2) +
  geom_point(color = "darkblue") +
  labs(title = "Viewership Over Time",
       x = "Episode Number",
       y = "Millions of Viewers") +
  theme_minimal()
```

## Changes in Viewership

```{r}
viewership_data <- viewership_data %>%
  arrange(EpisodeNumber) %>%
  mutate(Change = Viewers - lag(Viewers))

ggplot(viewership_data, aes(x = EpisodeNumber, y = Change)) +
  geom_col(fill = "tomato") +
  labs(title = "Episode-to-Episode Change",
       x = "Episode Number",
       y = "Change in Viewers (Millions)") +
  theme_minimal()
```

# Observations

- The highest viewership was during early seasons, reaching `r max(viewership_data$Viewers)` million viewers.
- Between Season 3 and Season 5, viewership declined by about `r round(viewership_data$Viewers[viewership_data$Season == 3][1] - viewership_data$Viewers[viewership_data$Season == 5][1], 2)` million viewers.
- The final seasons maintained stable viewership levels around `r round(mean(viewership_data$Viewers[viewership_data$Season >= 7], na.rm = TRUE), 2)` million viewers.
