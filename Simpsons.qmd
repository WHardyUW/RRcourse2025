plt.figure(figsize=(10,5))
plt.bar(seasons[1:], changes, color=['#2CA02C' if x >=0 else '#D62728' for x in changes])
plt.axhline(0, color='black', linewidth=0.8)
plt.title("Yearly Viewership Changes")
plt.xlabel("Season Number")
plt.ylabel("Percentage Change")

## 6. Trend Analysis  

The viewership data reveals several significant patterns in *The Simpsons'* audience trends over its 35-season run:

**Peak Performance Era**

The show reached its highest popularity during **Season 3** (1991-92), averaging **23.1 million viewers** per episode. This represented a dramatic **72.4% increase** from Season 1's average, demonstrating the series' rapid growth in its early years.

**Critical Decline Period**

The most substantial viewership drop occurred between **Seasons 9-10** (1997-99), with a **28.0% decrease** in average viewership. This coincided with:
- Increased competition from other animated series
- Changes in writing staff
- Shifting audience preferences

**Modern Era Stability**

In recent seasons (31-35), the show has stabilized with:
- An average of **1.3 million viewers**
- Seasonal fluctuations of **Â±15.4%**  
While significantly lower than peak numbers, this demonstrates the series maintains a loyal core audience.

**Long-Term Trend**

The overall **91.0% decline** from Season 1 to Season 35 reflects both:
1. Natural aging of a long-running series
2. Fundamental changes in television viewing habits
3. Increased competition in the streaming era

*Despite these declines, The Simpsons remains culturally significant and profitable through syndication and streaming deals.*
